is lost, having, in all probability, been removed in

each occasionally corrects the errors of the other.
The Saxon version is an independent one, differing
radically from that here printed3 although, as might
naturally be expected, they have much in common.
A few of the Hymns are provided with a musical
notation.

The Cottonian Manuscript, Vespasian, D. xii.

text, he has added a paraphrase of that text into
