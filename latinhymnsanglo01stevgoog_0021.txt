Northenr origin. There is no evidence to connect it
with the Scriptorium of the distinguished Mouastcry
within whose walls itis preserved3 on the contrary,
there are indicatious of a Seuthem birth-place.¹
The interlinear glossis au indisputable specimen of
Wcsteru Saxon. Its age is probably a little later
than the Normau Conquest ; it is clearly aud elegautly‚
though not always correotly writteu; but its errors
are neither so formidable nor so numerous as those
which disiigure many of the Manuscripts of that
period. An attempt has been made by a subsequeut
hand to amend some of these blunders, and in other
respecta to alter the earlier reading ol the Latin -
not always successfully, - circumstances which will
account for the discrepancies which may here and
there be detected between the original aud the
translation.

The Anglo-Saxou version exhibita no striking
peculiarities. It isa good specimen of the ordinary
Westeru Saxon of the period. The Student will

observo many instaures of the gradual melting of the
Saxon into English hythe rejectiones the stricter'

forms of the earlier grammar.

¹ lf the Editor might venture to hazard a conjecture, founded on
nothing more definite thau the style of writing and the general appearance
aud execution ol the book, lie would be inclined to attribute its origin to
Wiuelrcstcr. According to llud (catalog. MSS. codd. Ecclesiae Dunelm.‚
p. 174), it was given to tlrc Liluury ol Durlrour by Thomas Wharton‚ Esq.
